          %h3 Our Purpose
          %p 
            Many course scheduling websites rank classes based on difficulty and other factors that do not accurately represent the professorâ€™s teaching skill. The purpose of this application is for UC Berkeley students to choose classes taught by the most worthwhile professors. These professors have awards such as the Distinguished Teaching Award or other department specific awards. We truly believe that taking classes from these professors will make your college experience more rewarding.
